      # The option to clone gold is here for for performance reasons only.

      # holds all baseline figures. When there is more than one Reviewable
      # present, we need to clone gold, otherwise we would break the calculated
      # values. The easy way out would be to clone gold in any event, but quite
      # often there will be only one item we need to review - a clone is
      # unnecessary then and comes at a cost then - when the treebank file is
      # large it's not only time-expensive, but also adds memory load, which we
      # have enough already of already.
      # Of course this causes pollution of the original Gold instance - for now
      # there's no use case in sight where it would be after this side-effect
      # has been caused.
